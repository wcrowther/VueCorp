            <p class="w-full">
                The VueCorp solution is structured to establish a clear separation of concerns by isolating
                the frontend (Vue) and backend (Asp.net Minimal Api) into distinct projects. Despite this separation,
                the template integrates the build and publish processes so that both layers can be compiled and deployed
                as a single web application, simplifying hosting while maintaining a modular architecture.

                    You can run both projects in <b>Visual Studio 2022</b> using a normal

                    use <b>VSCode</b> for the <b>Vuejs</b> project, launching them separately for debugging

                    and how to call them. This can be configured to not display in Production.

           <p class="w-full">
                The Vue.js 3.5 project uses the Composition Api with Vite to build and Pinia as a
                data store. To minimize boilerplate, we use Unplugin for page-based routing, auto-configure Vue imports,
                and your auto-import your custom components. Rather than use a UI import library we build
                simple reusable components for things like list pagers, toasts, modals, form inputs, etc,
                to reduce outside dependencies.

                    <span>Vite</span>
                    Our Vue project uses Vite for our builds, allowing for instantaneous feedback when you make changes 
                    to a Vue page or component with it's lightning fast HMR (hot model replacement).

                <li>
                    <span>Page-based Routing</span>
                    Uses page-based routing with 'unplugin-vue-router' that auto configures Vue Router based on the 
                    hierarchy of the src/Pages folder. Our SiteMap component dynamically shows the site layout.

                    <span>SPA Site Navigation</span>
                    The site dynamically loads nested components without page reload and provides two levels of 
                    tabbed navigation.

                    <span>Removing Boilerplate Code</span>
                    We use 'unplugin-vue-components' and 'unplugin-auto-import' to remove
                    boilerplate code by auto-importing Vue and custom components on demand  leaving
                    the code to more succinctly express the logic.

                    <span>Custom Components</span>
                    Rather than focusing on an external UI library, we have many example custom components for 
                    you to build on such as form inputs (w/ validation), modal and confirmation controls, 
                    layout controls, and a flexible icon control.

                <li>
                    <span>List Pager w/ Debugger</span>
                    For lists, we have an integrated list pager (with debugger) with an advanced search feature. 
                    For mobile, the user can easily switch between list or detail views.

                <li>
                    <span>Search / Advanced Search</span>
                    The integrated search allows the user to use multiple search terms in a single query and 
                    further narrow their search with additional parameters in a modal window.

                    <span>TailwindCss</span>
                    The site is build using TailwindCss so that you can look at a component and see how it is 
                    styled but also utilizes css variables so that you can switch out designs on the fly. Components
                    can have there own isolated classes when that is required.

                <li>
                    <span>Adaptive Mobile / Web Design</span>
                    The site is designe to be adaptive for the web at higher resolutions and for mobile when space 
                    is limited. The design features a left collapsible menu area for displaying lists.

                    <span>Keyboard Shortcuts</span>
                    For maximum productivity on the web, contextual keyboard shortcuts are integrated into the UI. 
                    Ctrl + S to save. Esc to hide left navigation. Arrow keys to move the prev / next record, etc.

                <li>
                    <span>Pinia Datastores</span>
                    We use Pinia for global state management and to access services and data stores. This allows 
                    flexibility for cross-cutting concerns and components to be loosely coupled.

                <li>
                    <span>Custom API</span>
                    Our simple custom setup for API access manages JWT tokens / Cookies and return message with 
                    built-in toasts for when errors occur.

                    <span>VueUse</span>
                    We utilize 'VueUse' to extend Vue functionality for local storage, clipboard copying,
                    app screen size, etc. and it contains many other useful capabilities.
