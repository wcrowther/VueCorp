# `src` Directory Structure and Descriptions

The `src` directory contains the main source code for the Vue application. Below is a breakdown of its top-level elements, with details for key subfolders and files.

---

## Folders

### `components/`
Reusable Vue components that encapsulate UI elements and logic. Organized by feature or layout.

- **`Boxes/`**
  - Contains components for displaying boxed content.
    - `InfoBox.vue`: Shows its slot content only when the application's `infoLevel` is greater than 1. Used for contextual information based on user settings.

- **`Layout/`**
  - Components related to the application's layout and structure.
    - `MainSidebar.vue`: Responsive sidebar component. Uses the app store and window size to automatically show or hide itself based on a breakpoint (501px). The sidebar transitions smoothly and adapts to different screen sizes.

- *(Other folders may exist for additional component groups, such as forms, navigation, etc.)*

---

### `views/`
Vue components representing full pages or major application views. Each file typically maps to a route in the application.

- Example: `HomeView.vue`, `DashboardView.vue`, etc.  
  *(Actual files may vary depending on your project structure.)*

---

### `store/`
Pinia or Vuex store modules for managing global application state.

- Example: `appStore.js` or `appStore.ts`  
  *(Defines state such as `infoLevel`, `sideBarHidden`, etc.)*

---

### `router/`
Defines application routes and navigation logic.

- Example: `index.js` or `index.ts`  
  *(Configures paths, route guards, and lazy loading of views.)*

---

### `assets/`
Static assets such as images, fonts, and icons used within the application.

---

### `styles/`
Global and shared style files, such as CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind configuration overrides.

---
